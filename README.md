# GitHub Exit

Microsoft has a history of trying to destroy competing software (see [EEE-Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish)).
They have improved, but still ignore many values of [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) when they think they can make money.

Some of the latest fuckups are:

- Deleting any trace of people, that they ever existed on GitHub, on request of the US government ([source comming]())
- Ignoring valid questions regarding details of [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/) ([source](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/jun/30/give-up-github-launch/))


## Codeberg

I decided to move all my repos to [Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org) and delete them from GitHub.
My GitHub account stays active in order to be able to contribute to projects that decided to or can't move away from GitHub.
